        The data available on this page is not 100% accurate. Data collection
        involves computer vision and image classification using a neural
        network, and as such, there is a slight error rate. This error rate is
        most apparent in some charts where the incorrect role appears, such as a
        support chart containing Echo. More information on data collection is
        available on my{" "}

        <strong>What is this data?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The data below is taken from the in-game top 500 leaderboards. The
        information available there includes a single player's matches played
        and their top 3 heroes played. The charts and categories below represent
        data for the hero "slot" in a top 500 leaderboard entry. For example,
        they count the number of people who have Kiriko as their most played
        hero, or Widowmaker as their second most played hero. The data is a
        high-level overview of what heroes are popular or unpopular and is by no
        means an accurate representation of hero pick rates.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-2">
        <strong>When is the data updated?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset is updated once per season. Starting in season 8, the most
        recent season will be updated weekly, overwritten each week until the
        end of the season
